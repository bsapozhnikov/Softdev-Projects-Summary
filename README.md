This python app uses flask, forms, web scraping, and regular expressions to create a search engine. It recognizes "who" and "when" searches and uses the google package to get links to search results. Then, the program scrapes the html using beautiful soup and identifies possible answers using regular expressions. Finally, the results are aggregated and the top answers are displayed.
